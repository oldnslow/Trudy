Deconstructed [Orbiter Extruder](https://www.orbiterprojects.com/the-true-story-of-orbiter-v2-0/) with Nozzle Coaxial Motor for [Duet3D Delta Smart Effector](https://www.duet3d.com/deltasmarteffector)

Currently in design stage (85%).  Motivation is to have a Duet3D Smart Effector mounted dual drive extruder that minimizes filament path length between extruder and hot end without limiting effector platform excursion radius.

Retains the 7.5 reduction ratio and optionally motor of the Orbiter but performance will be reduced by addition of bevel and spur gear pairs to drive train.  Filament exit guide sits directly on hot end heatsink.  Filament drive compression is spring loaded in seven increments and the driven fiament wheel is removeable to aid cleaning. 

All parts sourceable from Aliexpress, but at the moment, requires lathe, including 4-jaw operations and likely resin/SLS for some components.
